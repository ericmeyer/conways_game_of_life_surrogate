# Conway's Game of Life

This is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life created on the Global Day of Code Retreat.  It is meant to provide an example migration to using the Surrogate gem from using RSpec dynamic mocks.  The code was originally implemented using RSpec, and afterwards converted to using Surrogate.
